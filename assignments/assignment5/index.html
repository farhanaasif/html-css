                  <h5>1. Calculating Values With calc()</h5>
                  <p>calc() function. It allows to do simple arithmetic calculations inside CSS. I used to determined the div widths while I was working on responsive layouts of this assignment to place contents correctly.</p>
                  <p><strong>Example:</strong> width: calc(100% - 40px);</p>
                  <p><strong>Browser Support:</strong> It is supported by all <a href = "http://b3.ms/Y2g9KJ0eM0l3">browsers</a> except Opera 8.0. and IE 8.0.</p>

                  <h5>Importing Awesome fonts</h5>
                  <p>We can add beautiful fonts by simply including a style-sheet in our page. I am importing fonts in my style-sheet. </p>
                  <p><strong>Example:</strong> Add link of the font on top of style sheet like this: </p>
                  <p>@import url("font-awesome.min.css");</p>
                  <p>@import url("http://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Lato:400,400italic,700,700italic|Source+Code+Pro:400");</p>
                  <p>We can simple use font like we normally do :</p>
                  <p>font-family: "Lato", sans-serif;</p>
                  <p><strong>Browser Suport:</strong> It works well on all browsers including old versions of IE.</p>
