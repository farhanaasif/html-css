Two New HTML tags I explored  and used on this page.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - -
#1   <details> TAG
- - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Semantics: <details>
              <summary>text</summary>
          </details>

Description: This tag defines additional details that the user can view or hide in the page view. It creates accordion-like widget that the we can toggle open and closed. Both starting and ending tag are mandatory. Inside , we can put any sort of content we want. <summary> is optional child element of this tag. It is possible to nest this tag.

Example:
     <details>
        <summary>show/hide</summary>
        <p>
          Some text
        </p>
      </details>

Browser support: only Chrome supports <details> tag.

Attributes:
  It uses open attribute. By default view is hidden, open attributes can be uses to
  keep it visible.
  e.g.
     <details open>
        <summary>show/hide</summary>
        <p>
          Some text
        </p>
      </details>

Notes:
  * Html validator gives a warning message for this tag:
  [Warning Message: The details element is not supported properly by browsers yet. ]

  * Although <summary> is said option, when I tried validating page without I got error that a required element is missing..
  [Error message]  Element details is missing a required instance of child element summary.]

Where I used it: I used it to display my food blog link in the footer.
